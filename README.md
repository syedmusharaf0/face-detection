# face-detection
This project demonstrates real-time face detection using Python and OpenCV. The program utilizes the computer's camera to detect up to three faces simultaneously
this project continuously captures live video from a webcam, detects faces in each frame using a trained model, and visually indicates the detected faces by drawing rectangles around them on the screen. This provides a real-time demonstration of face detection using OpenCV in Python.
